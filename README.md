## A fun jeopardy app
This was an assessment for the Springboard Software Engineering program.

# Requirements:
1. The game board should be 6 categories across, 5 question down, displayed in a table. Above this should be a header row with the name of each category.
2. At the start of the game, you should randomly pick 6 categories from the jService API. For each category, you should randomly select 5 questions for that category.
3. Initially, the board should show with ? on each spot on the board (on the real TV show, it shows dollar amount, but we won’t implement this).
4. When the user clicks on a clue ?, it should replace that with the question text.
5. When the user clicks on a visible question on the board, it should change to the answer (if they click on a visible answer, nothing should happen)
6. When the user clicks the “Restart” button at the bottom of the page, it should load new categories and questions.
